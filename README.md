# ADNS-9800_Pixel_Graber
This is Project for getting images from ADNS-9800 Sensor

I want to use ADNS9800 with a maximum proizvoditelnosti and the pictures being used beyond the simple transfer of raw data to Serial Port and composed of packets with the use of standards HDCL. That allows you to develop images on frames at the stage of sending and it is as easy to take them in a normal form, as frame packages.
